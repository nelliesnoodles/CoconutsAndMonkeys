# CoconutsAndMonkeys
Playing with making some python methods to figure out math puzzle: coconuts and monkeys

## the plan:

Make a loop or recursion that can find the smallest original pile.  

The loop, recurse_pile(n, x) is a work in progress.

where n is the number of pirates, and x is the original amount in the pile which will be reduced each time 

a pirate divides the pile and tosses a coconut to a monkey.

## Quick intro:

Five pirates on an island start with a pile of coconuts of unknown quantity.

Each pirate sneaks out in turn at night, divides the pile up into 5 equal parts.

The pirate takes his 1/5 share out of the pile and hides it.

There is always 1 coconut remaining after this division, the pirate gives it to a monkey.

After all five have divided up the pile and hidden their share, and giving the monkey 1 remaining...
 
The pile in the morning is equally divisible by 5, with no raimaner.
